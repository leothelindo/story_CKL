# The Legend of Hedge and the Chair with Four Legs

There was once a large raccoon named Hedge.
The large raccoon's name was ted.
There was once a chair with four legs.
Hedge found the chair while dumpster diving for dinner.
Chair kindly invited Hedge into his three story igloo.
In the igloo chair introduced ted to his friend Fat rat.
Fat rat enjoyed consuming many calories, hence the nickname fat rat.
